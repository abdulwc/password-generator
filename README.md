<h1>Python Password Generator</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

Welcome to my Python Password Generator project! This repository contains a Python script designed to create strong, secure passwords. This tool will generate passwords that are both random and difficult to crack and eliminates the hassle of having to think up new password. It operates independently of any web browser, providing a versatile tool that can be used in a variety of contexts.


<h2>Key Highlights & Features</h2>

- **Python Script**: A simple and effective script for generating secure passwords.
- **Customizable Password Length**: Users have the flexibility to specify the length of the password according to their needs.
- **Inclusion of Special Characters**: Offers the option to include special characters, enhancing password complexity.
- **Usability from Command Line**: This script can be easily used from the command line, making it accessible for quick password generation.
- **User Input Handling**: Allows for user customization of password length and character types through interactive prompts.

<h2>Usage</h2>

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Run the script using Python:

    ```bash
    python password_generator.py
    ```
     Note: On some systems, particularly newer ones where Python 3 is the default, the command `python` will suffice. However, on systems where Python 2.x and Python 3.x coexist, you may need to use `python3`.

3. Follow the on-screen prompts to specify password length and character inclusion.
